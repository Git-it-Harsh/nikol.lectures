## Operand & Operators
- Operands are the value on whom we perform operation.

- Operators define the operation for given operands _Value_.

# Types Operators
## 1 : Arithmetics
1. Addition
Which is used to add to operands. Wheather it is int or float.denoted by '+'

```python
a = 10
b = 20
c = a+b
```
2. Substraction:
Which  is used to substract one operand from another operands. denoted by '-'
```python
a = 10
b = 4
c = a-b
```
3. multication
Which is used to multipy 2 operands. denoted by '*' sign.
```python
a = 10
b = 4
c = a*b
```
4. division
which is used to divide one operand with another operand and return float value. denoted by '/'
```python

a = 94
b = 2
c = a/b
```
5. integer division
which is used to get int value from division result. which is denoted by '//'

```python
a = 5
b = 2
c = a//b
```


6. modulo
which is used to find reminder after division of 2 operands. denoted '%'

```python
a = 2
b = 3
c = a%b
```

7. exponetial (power)
This operator used to find power of given operand by another operand. denoted by '**'

```python
a = 39
b = 3
c = a**b
```
## 2 : Relational
this operators used to compare operands & return `True` if comparision is valid or `False`
1. `>` greater than.
return True if first operand is greater than second one.
```python
a = 30
b = 3
c = a>b
``` 
## 3 : logical
## 4 : bitwise
## 5 : assignment
## 6 : membership
## 7 : Indentity
